          <h3>Curo</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;In this case study, we developed our design and critique
            skills by iteratively creating digital interfaces for a Y Combinator
            startup called
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/curo"
              target="_blank"
              >Curo</a
            >. Curo's mission is to connect electric vehicle (EV) fleet managers
            and charger depot owners to take advantage of charger downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;For example, imagine a regional manager of Amazon's electric
            delivery vehicles, who has doesn't have enough chargers for their
            whole fleet and doesn't want to build more. Imagine also a grocery
            store owner whose parking lot has many EV chargers that aren't used
            overnight while the store is closed. These parties can find one
            another Curo for mutual benefit: the fleet manager finds affordable,
            reliable charging spots and the depot owner makes money from leasing
            their chargers at odd hours.
          </p>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;Throughout the design process, we avoided looking at any of
            Curo's real interfaces, so that our approach to solving their
            problem would be completely independent from theirs. After we
            understood their mission, we began by drawing sketches depicting our
            initial ideas of desktop and mobile interfaces, and then turned
            these sketches into lo-fi wireframes. Next, we did a critique of our
            wireframes and created a hi-fi prototype in Figma, which we tested
            with users. Each of these steps will be discussed in the below
            sections.
