          <h3>Curo</h3>
          <p>
            In this case study, we developed our design and critique skills by
            iteratively creating digital interfaces for a Y Combinator startup
            called
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/curo"
              target="_blank"
              >Curo</a
            >. Curo's mission is to connect electric vehicle (EV) fleet managers
            and charger depot owners to take advantage of charger downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, imagine a regional manager of Amazon's electric
            delivery vehicles, who has doesn't have enough chargers for their
            whole fleet and doesn't want to build more. Imagine also a grocery
            store owner whose parking lot has many EV chargers that aren't used
            overnight while the store is closed. These parties can find one
            another Curo for mutual benefit: the fleet manager finds affordable,
            reliable charging spots and the depot owner makes money from leasing
            their chargers at odd hours.
          </p>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the design process, we avoided looking at any of Curo's
            real interfaces, so that our approach would be completely
            independent from theirs. We began by drawing sketches depicting our
            initial ideas of desktop and mobile interfaces, and then turned
            these sketches into lo-fi wireframes. Next, critiqued our wireframes
            and created a hi-fi prototype in Figma, which we tested with users.
            Each of these steps will be discussed in the below sections.
          </p>

        <h2>Initial Sketches and Ideation</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <h3>Sketches Approach</h3>
          <p>
            As described, our very first step was sketching. To design Curo's
            platform from the ground up, each team member independently sketched
            out their vision for the UI. We each created three sketches,
            exploring different screen views and formats (desktop vs. mobile).
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              By working independently, we generated a diverse set of design
              ideas, each offering a unique approach to presenting Curo's core
              functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              We also avoided looking at current Curo designs to form original
              sketches and designs. This ultimately enabled us to add our own
              perspective and personalization to the sketches/lo-fi prototypes.
            </li>
            <li>
              These sketches allowed us to consider a range of user interactions
              and layouts before converging on shared design elements. This
              initial ideation phase laid the foundation for our lo-fi
              wireframes and informed key interface decisions moving forward.

              When designing my 4 screens, my main goal was to display the core
              of the initial flow for desktop users. The first screen allows
              users to sign up as either of the two user groups, and then there
              is one screen for the fleet managers and two screens for the depot
              owners (which I initially called charger owners). The screen for
              the fleet managers displays the page where they can manage the
              chargers they have leased, whereas the depot owners' pages allow
              them to manage their chargers and view their leasers.

              I wanted to sketch designs that were mostly centered around the
              driver and fleet manager. Thus, I sketched three screens that were
              reminiscent of mobile maps apps like Google Maps but with
              additional features like pinned locations for all the charging
              stations. I also added more tabs like a vehicle tracking page and
              a charging details page so that fleet managers could easily gather
              insights on all of their vehicles.

              When designing the screens, my main goal was to display the flow

              sign into the app. The second screen allows the fleet manager to
              easily search for different chargers compatible with their fleet.
              The last screen allows a depot owner to see all of their chargers
              and decommission them from the platform if there may be an issue.

            To design this lo-fi prototype, we met to discuss our vision for the
            wireframes, and then split respoonsibility for the pages we believed
            to be necessary for the platform. We all focused on a wireframe page
            that would be an important step in the user's journey as a Fleet
            Manager and EV Charger Depot Owner.

            <p>
              • The goal with this page was to create a simple dashboard with
              quick actions and all the information that a EV charger owner
              would need to manage their depot.
            </p>
            <p>
              • We chose to use a Bento Grid layout to allow for a clean and
              organized view of the information. Some of the cards are clickable
              and allow the user to view more information about their depots or
              reservation requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              • We chose to keep the earnings in the center as this one of the
              most important pieces of information for the depot owner so they
              can see how Curo is benefitting them.
            </p>
            <p>
              • This page was hinted at in a couple of the initial sketches but
              was not explicitly sketched out. We chose to design this page as
              it is the main page that depot owners would see when they log in
              to Curo and would contain a summary of all the important
              information they need.

          <h3>Feedback to Each Other</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              As we worked, we iterated on our wireframes based on feedback we
              gave each other:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Adding a robust messaging functionality would greatly improve
                communication between fleet managers and depot owners. While
                phone contact was appreciated, in-app messaging needs to be more
                visible and intuitive to support real-time coordination and
                trust-building.
              </li>
              <li>
                Making the sidebar collapsible could enhance usability by giving
                users more space to view critical information—especially helpful
                when managing multiple reservation requests or comparing depot
                data. This small change could improve overall clarity and reduce
                the need for excessive scrolling.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the hi-fi prototype, we suggest introducing mirrored views
                for depot owners that align with what fleet managers currently
                see in Screens 2 and 3. This would support consistency across
                roles, help users quickly understand the platform, and reduce
                the learning curve for first-time users.
              </li>
              <li>
                As we continue refining the user experience, it's important to
                surface key decision-making data—such as charging slot
                availability and total reserved slots—early in the user flow.
                Doing so empowers users to act with confidence and minimizes
                hesitation during critical steps like accepting or rejecting a
                request.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <br />
          <h3>Feedback From Critique</h3>
          <p>
            Then, we met with interaction designer Audrey Chou seeking feedback
            on our wireframes during a critique. Audrey gave us a variety of
            feedback on our lo-fi wireframes that informed our designs moving
            forward:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Maintain consistent design patterns across all screens to improve
              user familiarity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Incorporate filtering capabilities into the search experience for
              both fleet managers and depot owners would significantly enhance
              usability. This would allow for faster decision-making and makes
              the interface feel more responsive to user intent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider reorganizing the dashboard layout into a more compact,
              evenly spaced grid. Extra whitespace can give the impression of an
              incomplete design.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding short, contextual descriptions to wireframes would clarify
              the purpose of each section and guide both users and stakeholders
              through the interface. It ensures the intent behind each component
              is clearly communicated.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />

          <p>
            After iterating on and improving our lo-fi wireframes, our next step
            was to add interactability and detail to our prototypes with a hi-fi
            prototype in Figma. In the hi-fi
            <a

            ensuring adherence to best practices in UI design:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As mentioned, we focused on bringing to life our Balsamiq lo-fi
              prototype along with critique feedback to clarify our direction
              moving forward. Our critic, Audrey, emphasized improving the
              information hierarchy, specifically, where and when information is
              presented to the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              She felt that we could enhance the experience by displaying more
              information upfront, reducing the number of clicks required to
              access key details. We balanced this feedback with our belief in
              maintaining a more minimal interface until the user actively seeks
              additional information through interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ultimately, we retained most of our initial wireframe designs but
              added a few key details that would be useful for most users,
              separating them from the more comprehensive information available
              through card clicks.
            </li>
            <li>
              We also ensured visual and informational consistency across
              personas, making the interface more intuitive for both fleet
              managers and depot owners. Additionally, we added several features
              we felt were essential to the core product, most notably, the
              messaging page.

          <br />
          <p>
            As visible in the demo and Figma design, at the core of our UI is an
            onboarding flow that diverges based on user persona. We were
            inspired by marketplace platforms like Fiverr, which use a similar
            approach to create a simple and navigable user experience, described
            below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Depot owners are presented with a clean dashboard as their home
              screen, featuring clickable cards that reveal more information.
              From this dashboard, they can accept or reject reservation
              requests, edit their depot availability, and track depot
              statistics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Depot owners can also message fleet managers and manage
              communications through a dedicated messaging tab. While we
              designed both reservations and billing tabs, we chose not to
              implement those pages, as they would be relatively simple
              screens—one featuring a calendar view and the other a form.
            </li>
            <li>
              For fleet managers, the UI is much more map-focused. Their
              homepage displays a map view of open charging locations,
              encouraging them to make reservations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fleet managers also have a tab for tracking their vehicles and
              current reservations, which mirrors the homepage's map view to
              maintain visual consistency. Lastly, we designed a messaging page
              for them as well, enabling negotiations and communication with
              depot owners.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>User Testing Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Conducting usability tests with real users completing a core,
            multi-step task on your interactive hi-fi prototype is essential for
            gathering meaningful feedback and evaluating the app's primary
            functionality. Our objective was to have users log in as a depot
            owner and complete the core task of accepting a reservation request.
          </p>

          <h3>Questions We Asked Our Users</h3>
          <p><b>Before the usability test:</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>What would you typically expect from a sign-in experience?</li>
            <li>
              As a depot owner, what information and steps would you expect to
              see when accepting an EV reservation request?
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <b>After the usability test:</b>
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Was there anything confusing about where to find your reservation
              requests? Did you have a hard time finding where it was displayed?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did you feel like you had adequate information on the request
              details to make a decision on whether to accept or decline?
            </li>
            <li>
              Was it intuitive to know where to get more information or
              communicate with the fleet manager that requested?
            </li>
            <li>
              How confident are you that this reservation will be respected by
              the other party?
            </li>
            <li>
              How similar was the experience to what you expected? Do you think
              the differences were good or bad?

                expressed this process to be straightforward like any other
                sign-in process.
              </li>
              <li>
                The user was able to navigate the interface with relative ease
                and clicked on the first available request.
              </li>
              <li>
                The reservation request process was seen as straightforward and
                well-contextualized.
              </li>
              <li>
                There was some uncertainty about the number of available
                charging slots and the the in-app messaging feature was not
                immediately discoverable.
              </li>
              <li>
                The user clicked on the first available request and took time to
                review the request details. The user mentioned that the
                experience matched expectations and nothing was very confusing
                during the task.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Insights:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Visibility of critical information (slot availability and
                reservation impact) is key for confident decision-making.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users expect transparent, easy-to-read summaries of reservation
                requests.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quick access to communication tools like messaging is highly
                valued and could be built into the reservation request popup.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clearly showing total available vs. requested slots can reduce
                cognitive load for the user and make the experience more
                efficient.
              </li>
              <li>
                New users will benefit from guided cues/prompts to avoid missing

                In the pre-interview questions, the subject said that she
                expected a web sign-in process to be simple, fast, and require a
                username and password. When presented with the dashboard, she
                seemed to read each of the cards, found the Reservation Request
                Card, and clicked on the first reservation request.
              </li>
              <li>
                She quickly chose to log in as a depot owner instead of a fleet
                manager (and instead of signing up). Then, she tried to click
                the username field and nothing happened, so she pressed the

              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                In the post-interview questions, she stated that the experience

                One key point where this user test did not align with a real
                user experience is that the subject was instructed to accept a
                reservation request, and did not have any reason not to accept
                it.
              </li>
              <li>
                So, my subject shared that she did not bother to read a lot of
                the reservation request information, since she knew the task was
                to accept the reservation.
              </li>
              <li>
                While this limited our ability to gauge whether adequate
                information was shared on the reservation request page, it did
                affirm for us that this task was easy and intuitive to complete.

            <ul>
              <li>
                In the pre-interview questions, the interviewee shared that he
                expected a sign-in process to be straightforward, requiring only
                a username and password.
              </li>
              <li>
                He immediately selected the option to log in as a depot
                owner—skipping the fleet manager option and the sign-up flow.
                Upon trying to click into the username field with no response,
                he instinctively clicked the login button, which aligned with
                the intended flow for our UI.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once on the dashboard, he scanned and read out each of the cards
                and information and was quickly able to locate the Reservation
                Request Card.
              </li>
              <li>
                He clicked on the first available request. However, he did not
                spend much time reviewing the detailed information in the card
                and instead clicked "Accept" almost immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the usability test, when asked further questions, he
                mentioned that the experience matched his expectations and that
                he didn't encounter anything confusing or difficult during the
                task.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Insights:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The main limitation of this user test was that the subject was
                instructed to accept a reservation request.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because of this, he did not feel the need to thoroughly review
                the reservation's content, knowing that the task had a
                pre-determined flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, this usability interview confirmed that the flow to
                locate and accept a reservation was intuitive and easy to
                follow, indicating that the basic functionality was accessible
                and understandable to first-time users.

                The user was able to find the reservation request card and
                accept the reservation, but did not immediately see the
                reservations part of the dashboard.
              </li>
              <li>
                The user expected more information about the reservation request
                in the pre-interview than they were able to find in the actual
                product.
              </li>
              <li>
                They user scrutinized the reservatio details to ensure that they
                fully understood the nature of the reservation before accepting
                it.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Some depot owners might need more infromation or context about
                the reservation before accepting it. We should implement direct
                messaging from the reservation request page.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we want to optimize for number of reservations accepted, we
                should make the reservation request card more prominent on the
                dashboard.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users could be unsure about their decision; we should allow them
                to edit their response or cancel the reservation after accepting
                it.

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <p>
            Throughout working on this case study, we each gained skills and
            experiences important to interaction designers, listed below.
          </p>
          <p><b>Sarah:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, I significantly improved my prototyping skills in Figma.
              More broadly, I learned how important it is to be specific with
              prompts when performing user tests. Not only do you need to
              present the subject with the task, you also need to ask them to
              assume the mindset of someone that they're not.
            </li>
            <li>
              In this case, if I had told my subject to be a depot owner who
              needs to decide whether or not to accept the reservation request
              (instead of just telling them to accept it), I could have gauged
              whether there was sufficient information rather than just the fact
              that the task was possible.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Priyam:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Going from hand-drawn sketches to lo-fi and then eventually to
              hi-fi Figma designs was incredible insightful. The sketching
              process allowed me to think freely about how to structure
              information on the page and discover the ideal user experience for
              both stakeholders.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, the ability to discuss my thought process with my team and
              learning about their perspective allowed for a thoughtful feedback
              loop. Working in a team also emulated a real-world task where you
              work with other team members to go from ideation to an actual
              design/product.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Ethan:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This project taught me a lot about staying agile in the design
              process. Rather than dive head-first into a solution, taking time
              breaking the problem down into stakeholders and their needs gave
              us a solid foundation to design features without feeling like we
              weren't comprehensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              I also learned important Figma and Balsamiq prototyping
              techniques, including making component states in Figma and using
              multi-page prototyping features. This experience also made me more
              comfortable working with a team on product and design projects,
              since I learned how to communicate and compromise in design
              direction to ensure we have a product that we're proud of.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Zeeshan:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This project taught me the value of prototyping and user testing.
              From our initial sketches to the hi-fi prototypes, there has been
              a lot of revision and improvement. It couldn't have been possible
              without the discussions with the group and our critic Audrey,
              which were really crucial to designing a platform that
              successfully addresses the users' needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The project also taught me a lot about Figma as well as creating
              interesting animations! Overall, I learned how important it is to
              be flexible and constantly improve our product based on feedback.
