        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <h3>Curo</h3>
          <p>
            In this case study, we developed our design and critique skills by
            iteratively creating digital interfaces for a Y Combinator startup
            called
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/curo"
              target="_blank"
              >Curo</a
            >. Curo's mission is to connect electric vehicle (EV) fleet managers
            and charger depot owners to take advantage of charger downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, imagine a regional manager of Amazon's electric
            delivery vehicles, who has doesn't have enough chargers for their
            whole fleet and doesn't want to build more. Imagine also a grocery
            store owner whose parking lot has many EV chargers that aren't used
            overnight while the store is closed. These parties can find one
            another Curo for mutual benefit: the fleet manager finds affordable,
            reliable charging spots and the depot owner makes money from leasing
            their chargers at odd hours.
          </p>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the design process, we avoided looking at any of Curo's
            real interfaces, so that our approach to solving their problem would
            be completely independent from theirs. After we understood their
            mission, we began by drawing sketches depicting our initial ideas of
            desktop and mobile interfaces, and then turned these sketches into
            lo-fi wireframes. Next, we did a critique of our wireframes and
            created a hi-fi prototype in Figma, which we tested with users. Each
            of these steps will be discussed in the below sections.
          </p>

      <div id="ideation" class="ideation">
        <h2>Initial Sketches and Ideation</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <h3>Sketch Behind The Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            • To design Curo's platform from the ground up, each team member
            independently sketched out their vision for the UI. We each created
            three sketches, exploring different screen views and formats
            (desktop vs. mobile).
          </p>
          <p>
            • By working independently, we generated a diverse set of design
            ideas, each offering a unique approach to presenting Curo's core
            functionality. Furthermore, we restrained from looking at current
            Curo designs to form original sketches and designs. This ultimately
            enabled us to add our own perspective and personalization to the
            sketches/lo-fi prototypes.
          </p>
          <p>
            • These sketches allowed us to consider a range of user interactions
            and layouts before converging on shared design elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            • This initial ideation phase laid the foundation for our lo-fi
            wireframes and informed key interface decisions moving forward.

        <div class="txt-bx">
          <h3>Wireframes Behind The Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            • To design a lo-fi prototype for Curo's platform, each team member
            independently created a wireframe for the pages we believed to be
            necessary for the platform. We all focused on a page that would be
            an important step in the user's journey as a Fleet Manager and EV
            Charger Depot Owner.
          </p>

          <div class="txt-bx">
            <h3>Screen 1: Sign-In/Sign-Up Page</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center">
              <img
                src="public/screen1.png"

            <p>
              • The goal for this page was to create an intuitive way for Fleet
              Managers and Depot Owners to sign in or create a new account.
            </p>
            <p>
              • A simple card layout with options for each stakeholder to
              Sign-In or Sign-Up was utilized to make Sign-In and Sign-Up
              relatively easy.
            </p>

              view for Fleet Managers to be able to locate their fleet and check
              on its charging status.
            </p>
            <p>
              • A view inspired by Airbnb was used as an efficient way for Fleet
              Managers to be able to view their vehicle's location on a map and
              a sidebar with cards detailing vehicle information such as
              charging status and cost.

            </div>
            <p>
              • The goal for this page was to create a simple yet comprehensive
              view for Fleet Managers to be able to locate chargers nearby them
              and see if those are compatible with their fleet and reserve them.
            </p>
            <p>
              • Once again a view inspired by Airbnb was used as an efficient
              way for Fleet Managers to be able to locate chargers on a map and
              a sidebar with cards detailing charger information such as cost
              and charging speed. We also wanted to maintain consistency with
              the Fleet View Page by using a similar sidebar and map design.

            </div>
            <p>
              • The goal with this page was to create a simple dashboard with
              quick actions and all the information that a EV charger owner
              would need to manage their depot.
            </p>
            <p>
              • We chose to use a Bento Grid layout to allow for a clean and
              organized view of the information. Some of the cards are clickable
              and allow the user to view more information about their depots or
              reservation requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              • We chose to keep the earnings in the center as this one of the
              most important pieces of information for the depot owner so they
              can see how Curo is benefitting them.

          </div>

            <h3>Our Feedback to Each Other</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              • Adding a robust messaging functionality would greatly improve
              communication between fleet managers and depot owners. While phone
              contact was appreciated, in-app messaging needs to be more visible
              and intuitive to support real-time coordination and
              trust-building.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              • Making the sidebar collapsible could enhance usability by giving
              users more space to view critical information—especially helpful
              when managing multiple reservation requests or comparing depot
              data. This small change could improve overall clarity and reduce
              the need for excessive scrolling.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              • For the hi-fi prototype, we suggest introducing mirrored views
              for depot owners that align with what fleet managers currently see
              in Screens 2 and 3. This would support consistency across roles,
              help users quickly understand the platform, and reduce the
              learning curve for first-time users.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              • As we continue refining the user experience, it's important to
              surface key decision-making data—such as charging slot
              availability and total reserved slots—early in the user flow.
              Doing so empowers users to act with confidence and minimizes
              hesitation during critical steps like accepting or rejecting a
              request.

            <h3>Feedback From TA</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            • Maintain consistent design patterns across all screens to improve
            user familiarity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            • Incorporating filtering capabilities into the search experience
            for both fleet managers and depot owners would significantly enhance
            usability. Allows for faster decision-making and makes the interface
            feel more responsive to user intent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            • Consider reorganizing the dashboard layout into a more compact,
            evenly spaced grid. Extra whitespace can give the impression of an
            incomplete design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            • Adding short, contextual descriptions to wireframes would clarify
            the purpose of each section and guide both users and stakeholders
            through the interface. It ensures the intent behind each component
            is clearly communicated.

            In our hi-fi prototype, we focused on building a unified brand
            identity for Curo while ensuring adherence to best practices in
            UI/UX design.
          </p>
                    
          <p>
            We began by reviewing our Balsamiq lo-fi prototype and TA feedback
            to clarify our direction moving forward. Our TA, Audrey, emphasized
            improving the information hierarchy—specifically, where and when
            information is presented to the user. She felt that we could enhance
            the experience by displaying more information upfront, reducing the
            number of clicks required to access key details. We balanced this
            feedback with our belief in maintaining a more minimal interface
            until the user actively seeks additional information through
            interaction.
          </p>
                    
          <p>
            Ultimately, we retained most of our initial wireframe designs but
            added a few key details that would be useful for most users,
            separating them from the more comprehensive information available
            through card clicks. We also ensured visual and informational
            consistency across personas, making the interface more intuitive for
            both fleet managers and depot owners. Additionally, we added several
            features we felt were essential to the core product—most notably,
            the messaging page.

            As you can see from the demo and Figma, at the core of our UI is an
            onboarding flow that diverges based on user persona. We were
            inspired by marketplace platforms like Fiverr, which use a similar
            approach to create a simple and navigable user experience.

            Depot owners are presented with a clean dashboard as their home
            screen, featuring clickable cards that reveal more information. From
            this dashboard, they can accept or reject reservation requests, edit
            their depot availability, and track depot statistics. They can also
            message fleet managers and manage communications through a dedicated
            messaging tab. While we designed both reservations and billing tabs,
            we chose not to implement those pages, as they would be relatively
            simple screens—one featuring a calendar view and the other a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            For fleet managers, the UI is much more map-focused. Their homepage
            displays a map view of open charging locations, encouraging them to
            make reservations. They also have a tab for tracking their vehicles
            and current reservations, which mirrors the homepage’s map view to
            maintain visual consistency. Lastly, we designed a messaging page
            for them as well, enabling negotiations and communication with depot
            owners.

            • Sarah: First, I significantly improved my prototyping skills in
            Figma. More broadly, I learned how important it is to be specific
            with prompts when performing user tests. Not only do you need to
            present the subject with the task, you also need to ask them to
            assume the mindset of someone that they’re not. In this case, if I
            had told my subject to be a depot owner who needs to decide whether
            or not to accept the reservation request (instead of just telling
            them to accept it), I could have gauged whether there was sufficient
            information rather than just the fact that the task was possible.

            • Priyam: Going from hand-drawn sketches to lo-fi and then
            eventually to hi-fi Figma designs was incredible insightful. The
            sketching process allowed me to think freely about how to structure
            information on the page and discover the ideal user experience for
            both stakeholders. Furthermore, the ability to discuss my thought
            process with my team and learning about their perspective allowed
            for a thoughtful feedback loop. Working in a team also emulated a
            real-world task where you work with other team members to go from
            ideation to an actual design/product.

            • Ethan: This project taught me a lot about staying agile in the
            design process. Rather than dive head-first into a solution, taking
            time breaking the problem down into stakeholders and their needs
            gave us a solid foundation to design features without feeling like
            we weren’t comprehensive. In addition, I learned important Figma and
            Balsamiq prototyping techniques, including making component states
            in Figma and using multi-page prototyping features. This experience
            also made me more comfortable working with a team on product and
            design projects, since I learned how to communicate and compromise
            in design direction to ensure we have a product that we’re proud of.

            • Zeeshan: This project really taught me the value of prototyping
            and user testing. From our initial sketches to the hi-fi prototypes,
            there has been a lot of revision and improvement. It couldn’t have
            been possible without the discussions with the group and TAs which
            were really crucial to designing a platform that successfully
            addresses the users’ needs. The project also taught me a lot about
            Figma as well as creating interesting animations! Overall, I learned
            how important it is to be flexible and constantly improve our
            product based on feedback.
