          <h3>Curo</h3>
          <p>
            In this case study, we developed our design and critique skills by
            iteratively creating digital interfaces for a Y Combinator startup
            called
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/curo"
              target="_blank"
              >Curo</a
            >. Curo's mission is to connect electric vehicle (EV) fleet managers
            and charger depot owners to take advantage of charger downtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, imagine a regional manager of Amazon's electric
            delivery vehicles, who has doesn't have enough chargers for their
            whole fleet and doesn't want to build more. Imagine also a grocery
            store owner whose parking lot has many EV chargers that aren't used
            overnight while the store is closed. These parties can find one
            another Curo for mutual benefit: the fleet manager finds affordable,
            reliable charging spots and the depot owner makes money from leasing
            their chargers at odd hours.
          </p>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the design process, we avoided looking at any of Curo's
            real interfaces, so that our approach to solving their problem would
            be completely independent from theirs. After we understood their
            mission, we began by drawing sketches depicting our initial ideas of
            desktop and mobile interfaces, and then turned these sketches into
            lo-fi wireframes. Next, we did a critique of our wireframes and
            created a hi-fi prototype in Figma, which we tested with users. Each
            of these steps will be discussed in the below sections.
          </p>

        <h2>Initial Sketches and Ideation</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <h3>Sketch Behind The Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            • To design Curo's platform from the ground up, each team member
            independently sketched out their vision for the UI. We each created
            three sketches, exploring different screen views and formats
            (desktop vs. mobile).
          </p>
          <p>
            • By working independently, we generated a diverse set of design
            ideas, each offering a unique approach to presenting Curo's core
            functionality. Furthermore, we restrained from looking at current
            Curo designs to form original sketches and designs. This ultimately
            enabled us to add our own perspective and personalization to the
            sketches/lo-fi prototypes.
          </p>
          <p>
            • These sketches allowed us to consider a range of user interactions
            and layouts before converging on shared design elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            • This initial ideation phase laid the foundation for our lo-fi
            wireframes and informed key interface decisions moving forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            When designing my 4 screens, my main goal was to display the core of
            the initial flow for desktop users. The first screen allows users to
            sign up as either of the two user groups, and then there is one
            screen for the fleet managers and two screens for the depot owners
            (which I initially called charger owners). The screen for the fleet
            managers displays the page where they can manage the chargers they
            have leased, whereas the depot owners' pages allow them to manage
            their chargers and view their leasers.

          <p>
            I wanted to sketch designs that were mostly centered around the
            driver and fleet manager. Thus, I sketched three screens that were
            reminiscent of mobile maps apps like Google Maps but with additional
            features like pinned locations for all the charging stations. I also
            added more tabs like a vehicle tracking page and a charging details
            page so that fleet managers could easily gather insights on all of
            their vehicles.

            When designing the screens, my main goal was to display the flow for
            mobile uses. The first screen is a simple way for users to sign into
            the app. The second screen allows the fleet manager to easily search
            for different chargers compatible with their fleet. The last screen
            allows a depot owner to see all of their chargers and decommission
            them from the platform if there may be an issue.

          <p>
            When designing my three screens, I focused on both fleet managers
            and depot owners, since Curo's platform fundamentally serves as a
            marketplace between these two user groups. The first screen is a map
            view that helps fleet managers search for and locate available
            chargers. It features a central map with a scrollable overlay of
            charger listings on the left, a search bar at the top, and a
            collapsible vertical navigation bar on the far left. The second
            screen is a standard card view that removes the map but retains all
            other functionality, allowing fleet managers to quickly scroll
            through all chargers available to lease. The third screen is
            targeted toward depot owners and showcases the signup process to add
            an EV charger to the platform. This includes fields for contact
            information, charger type, quantity, and location details.

          <h3>Wireframes Behind The Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            • To design a lo-fi prototype for Curo's platform, each team member
            independently created a wireframe for the pages we believed to be
            necessary for the platform. We all focused on a page that would be
            an important step in the user's journey as a Fleet Manager and EV
            Charger Depot Owner.

            <p>
              • A simple card layout with options for each stakeholder to
              Sign-In or Sign-Up was utilized to make Sign-In and Sign-Up

              • A view inspired by Airbnb was used as an efficient way for Fleet
              Managers to be able to view their vehicle's location on a map and

            <p>
              • Adding a robust messaging functionality would greatly improve
              communication between fleet managers and depot owners. While phone
              contact was appreciated, in-app messaging needs to be more visible
              and intuitive to support real-time coordination and
              trust-building.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              • Making the sidebar collapsible could enhance usability by giving
              users more space to view critical information—especially helpful
              when managing multiple reservation requests or comparing depot
              data. This small change could improve overall clarity and reduce
              the need for excessive scrolling.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              • For the hi-fi prototype, we suggest introducing mirrored views
              for depot owners that align with what fleet managers currently see
              in Screens 2 and 3. This would support consistency across roles,
              help users quickly understand the platform, and reduce the
              learning curve for first-time users.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              • As we continue refining the user experience, it's important to
              surface key decision-making data—such as charging slot
              availability and total reserved slots—early in the user flow.
              Doing so empowers users to act with confidence and minimizes
              hesitation during critical steps like accepting or rejecting a
              request.

            • Maintain consistent design patterns across all screens to improve
            user familiarity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            • Incorporating filtering capabilities into the search experience
            for both fleet managers and depot owners would significantly enhance
            usability. Allows for faster decision-making and makes the interface
            feel more responsive to user intent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            • Consider reorganizing the dashboard layout into a more compact,
            evenly spaced grid. Extra whitespace can give the impression of an
            incomplete design.

            • Adding short, contextual descriptions to wireframes would clarify
            the purpose of each section and guide both users and stakeholders
            through the interface. It ensures the intent behind each component
            is clearly communicated.

            In our hi-fi prototype, we focused on building a unified brand
            identity for Curo while ensuring adherence to best practices in
            UI/UX design.
          </p>
          <p>
            We began by reviewing our Balsamiq lo-fi prototype and TA feedback
            to clarify our direction moving forward. Our TA, Audrey, emphasized
            improving the information hierarchy—specifically, where and when
            information is presented to the user. She felt that we could enhance
            the experience by displaying more information upfront, reducing the
            number of clicks required to access key details. We balanced this
            feedback with our belief in maintaining a more minimal interface
            until the user actively seeks additional information through
            interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, we retained most of our initial wireframe designs but
            added a few key details that would be useful for most users,
            separating them from the more comprehensive information available
            through card clicks. We also ensured visual and informational
            consistency across personas, making the interface more intuitive for
            both fleet managers and depot owners. Additionally, we added several
            features we felt were essential to the core product—most notably,
            the messaging page.

            As you can see from the demo and Figma, at the core of our UI is an
            onboarding flow that diverges based on user persona. We were
            inspired by marketplace platforms like Fiverr, which use a similar
            approach to create a simple and navigable user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depot owners are presented with a clean dashboard as their home
            screen, featuring clickable cards that reveal more information. From
            this dashboard, they can accept or reject reservation requests, edit
            their depot availability, and track depot statistics. They can also
            message fleet managers and manage communications through a dedicated
            messaging tab. While we designed both reservations and billing tabs,
            we chose not to implement those pages, as they would be relatively
            simple screens—one featuring a calendar view and the other a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            For fleet managers, the UI is much more map-focused. Their homepage
            displays a map view of open charging locations, encouraging them to
            make reservations. They also have a tab for tracking their vehicles
            and current reservations, which mirrors the homepage's map view to
            maintain visual consistency. Lastly, we designed a messaging page
            for them as well, enabling negotiations and communication with depot
            owners.

          <h3>User Testing Behind The Scenes</h3>
          <p>
            • Conducting usability tests with real users completing a core,
            multi-step task on your interactive hi-fi prototype is essential for
            gathering meaningful feedback and evaluating the app's primary
            functionality. Our objective was to have users log in as a depot
            owner and complete the core task of accepting a reservation request.
          </p>

          <h3>Questions We Asked Our Users</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Before the usability test:</strong><br>
            • What would you typically expect from a sign-in experience?<br>
            • As a depot owner, what information and steps would you expect to see when accepting an EV reservation request?
          </p>
         
          <p>
            <strong>After the usability test:</strong><br>
            • Was there anything confusing about where to find your reservation requests? Did you have a hard time finding where it was displayed?<br>
            • Did you feel like you had adequate information on the request details to make a decision on whether to accept or decline?<br>
            • Was it intuitive to know where to get more information or communicate with the fleet manager that requested?<br>
            • How confident are you that this reservation will be respected by the other party?<br>
            • How similar was the experience to what you expected? Do you think the differences were good or bad?

          <p><b>Observations:</b></p>
          <p>
            • In the pre-interview questions, the interviewee shared that they
            expressed this process to be straightforward like any other sign-in
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            • The user was able to navigate the interface with relative ease and
            clicked on the first available request.
          </p>
          <p>
            • The reservation request process was seen as straightforward and
            well-contextualized.
          </p>
          <p>
            • There was some uncertainty about the number of available charging
            slots and the the in-app messaging feature was not immediately
            discoverable
          </p>
          <p>
            • The user clicked on the first available request and took time to
            review the request details.
          </p>

          <p>
            • The user mentioned that the experience matched expectations and
            nothing was very confusing during the task.
          </p>

          <p><b>Insights:</b></p>
          <p>
            • Visibility of critical information (slot availability and
            reservation impact) is key for confident decision-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Users expect transparent, easy-to-read summaries of reservation
            requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Quick access to communication tools like messaging is highly
            valued and could be built into the reservation request popup.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Clearly showing total available vs. requested slots can reduce
            cognitive load for the user and make the experience more efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            • New users will benefit from guided cues/prompts to avoid
            missing essential context before confirming actions.

            username and password.
          </p>
          <p>
            • He immediately selected the option to log in as a depot

          </p>
          <p>
            • Upon trying to click into the username field with no response, he
            instinctively clicked the login button, which aligned with the
            intended flow for our UI.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Once on the dashboard, he scanned and read out each of the cards
            and information and was quickly able to locate the Reservation
            Request Card.
          </p>
          <p>• He clicked on the first available request.</p>
          <p>
            • However, he did not spend much time reviewing the detailed
            information in the card and instead clicked "Accept" almost
            immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            • After the usability test, when asked further questions, he
            mentioned that the experience matched his expectations and that he
            didn't encounter anything confusing or difficult during the task.
          </p>

          <p><b>Insights:</b></p>
          <p>
            • The main limitation of this user test was that the subject was
            instructed to accept a reservation request.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Because of this, he did not feel the need to thoroughly review the
            reservation's content, knowing that the task had a pre-determined
            flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            • However, this usability interview confirmed that the flow to
            locate and accept a reservation was intuitive and easy to follow,
            indicating that the basic functionality was accessible and
            understandable to first-time users.

          <p><b>Insights:</b></p>
          <p>
            • Some depot owners might need more infromation or context about the

            messaging from the reservation request page.
          </p>
          <p>
            • If we want to optimize for number of reservations accepted, we
            should make the reservation request card more prominent on the

          </p>
          <p>
            • Users could be unsure about their decision; we should allow them

        <div class="txt-bx">
          <p>
            Throughout working on this case study, we each gained skills and
            experiences important to interaction designers, enumerated below.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Sarah: First, I significantly improved my prototyping skills in
            Figma. More broadly, I learned how important it is to be specific
            with prompts when performing user tests. Not only do you need to
            present the subject with the task, you also need to ask them to
            assume the mindset of someone that they're not. In this case, if I
            had told my subject to be a depot owner who needs to decide whether
            or not to accept the reservation request (instead of just telling
            them to accept it), I could have gauged whether there was sufficient
            information rather than just the fact that the task was possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Priyam: Going from hand-drawn sketches to lo-fi and then
            eventually to hi-fi Figma designs was incredible insightful. The
            sketching process allowed me to think freely about how to structure
            information on the page and discover the ideal user experience for
            both stakeholders. Furthermore, the ability to discuss my thought
            process with my team and learning about their perspective allowed
            for a thoughtful feedback loop. Working in a team also emulated a
            real-world task where you work with other team members to go from
            ideation to an actual design/product.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Ethan: This project taught me a lot about staying agile in the
            design process. Rather than dive head-first into a solution, taking
            time breaking the problem down into stakeholders and their needs
            gave us a solid foundation to design features without feeling like
            we weren't comprehensive. In addition, I learned important Figma and
            Balsamiq prototyping techniques, including making component states
            in Figma and using multi-page prototyping features. This experience
            also made me more comfortable working with a team on product and
            design projects, since I learned how to communicate and compromise
            in design direction to ensure we have a product that we're proud of.
          </p>
          <p>
            • Zeeshan: This project really taught me the value of prototyping
            and user testing. From our initial sketches to the hi-fi prototypes,
            there has been a lot of revision and improvement. It couldn't have
            been possible without the discussions with the group and TAs which
            were really crucial to designing a platform that successfully
            addresses the users' needs. The project also taught me a lot about
            Figma as well as creating interesting animations! Overall, I learned
            how important it is to be flexible and constantly improve our
            product based on feedback.
